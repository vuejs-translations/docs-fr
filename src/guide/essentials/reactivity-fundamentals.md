## Declaring Reactive State

<div class="options-api">

With Options API, we use the `data` option to declare reactive state of a component. The option value should be a function that returns an object. Vue will call the function when creating a new component instance, and wrap the returned object in its reactivity system. Any top-level properties of this object are proxied on the component instance (`this` in methods and lifecycle hooks):

```js{2-6}
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 1
    }
  },

  // `mounted` is a lifecycle hook which we will explain later
  mounted() {
    // `this` refers to the component instance.
    console.log(this.count) // => 1

    // data can be mutated as well
    this.count = 2
  }
}
```

These instance properties are only added when the instance is first created, so you need to ensure they are all present in the object returned by the `data` function. Where necessary, use `null`, `undefined` or some other placeholder value for properties where the desired value isn't yet available.

It is possible to add a new property directly to `this` without including it in `data`. However, properties added this way will not be able to trigger reactive updates.

Vue uses a `$` prefix when exposing its own built-in APIs via the component instance. It also reserves the prefix `_` for internal properties. You should avoid using names for top-level `data` properties that start with either of these characters.

### Reactive Proxy vs. Original \*

In Vue 3, data is made reactive by leveraging [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). Users coming from Vue 2 should be aware of the following edge case:

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      someObject: {}
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    const newObject = {}
    this.someObject = newObject

    console.log(newObject === this.someObject) // false
  }
}
```

When you access `this.someObject` after assigning it, the value is a reactive proxy of the original `newObject`. **Unlike in Vue 2, the original `newObject` is left intact and will not be made reactive: make sure to always access reactive state as a property of `this`.**

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

We can create a reactive object or array with the [`reactive()`](/api/reactivity-core.html#reactive) function:

```js
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
```

Reactive objects are [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and behave just like normal objects. The difference is that Vue is able to track the property access and mutations of a reactive object. If you are curious about the details, we explain how Vue's reactivity system works in [Reactivity in Depth](/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth.html) - but we recommend reading it after you have finished the main guide.

See also: [Typing Reactive](/guide/typescript/composition-api.html#typing-reactive) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

To use reactive state in a component's template, declare and return them from a component's `setup()` function:

```js{5,9-11}
import { reactive } from 'vue'

export default {
  // `setup` is a special hook dedicated for composition API.
  setup() {
    const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

    // expose the state to the template
    return {
      state
    }
  }
}
```

```vue-html
<div>{{ state.count }}</div>
```

Similarly, we can declare functions that mutate reactive state in the same scope, and expose it as a method alongside the state:

```js{7-9,14}
import { reactive } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

    function increment() {
      state.count++
    }

    // don't forget to expose the function as well.
    return {
      state,
      increment
    }
  }
}
```

Exposed methods are typically used as event listeners:

```vue-html
<button @click="increment">
  {{ state.count }}
</button>
```

### `<script setup>` \*\*

Manually exposing state and methods via `setup()` can be verbose. Luckily, it is only necessary when not using a build step. When using Single-File Components (SFCs), we can greatly simplify the usage with `<script setup>`:

```vue
<script setup>
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

function increment() {
  state.count++
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">
    {{ state.count }}
  </button>
</template>
```

Top-level imports and variables declared in `<script setup>` are automatically usable in the template of the same component.

> For the rest of the guide, we will be primarily using SFC + `<script setup>` syntax for Composition API code examples, as that is the most common usage for Vue developers.

</div>

<div class="options-api">

## Declaring Methods \*

To add methods to a component instance we use the `methods` option. This should be an object containing the desired methods:

```js{7-11}
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // methods can be called in lifecycle hooks, or other methods!
    this.increment()
  }
}
```

Vue automatically binds the `this` value for `methods` so that it always refers to the component instance. This ensures that a method retains the correct `this` value if it's used as an event listener or callback. You should avoid using arrow functions when defining `methods`, as that prevents Vue from binding the appropriate `this` value:

```js
export default {
  methods: {
    increment: () => {
      // BAD: no `this` access here!
    }
  }
}
```

Just like all other properties of the component instance, the `methods` are accessible from within the component's template. Inside a template they are most commonly used as event listeners:

```vue-html
<button @click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
```

In the example above, the method `increment` will be called when the `<button>` is clicked.

</div>

### DOM Update Timing

When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in the update cycle to ensure that each component needs to update only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the [nextTick()](/api/general.html#nexttick) global API:

<div class="composition-api">

```js
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

function increment() {
  count.value++
  nextTick(() => {
    // access updated DOM
  })
}
```

</div>
<div class="options-api">

```js
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

export default {
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
      nextTick(() => {
        // access updated DOM
      })
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

### Deep Reactivity

In Vue, state is deeply reactive by default. This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:

<div class="options-api">

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      obj: {
        nested: { count: 0 },
        arr: ['foo', 'bar']
      }
    }
  },
  methods: {
    mutateDeeply() {
      // these will work as expected.
      this.obj.nested.count++
      this.obj.arr.push('baz')
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

```js
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const obj = reactive({
  nested: { count: 0 },
  arr: ['foo', 'bar']
})

function mutateDeeply() {
  // these will work as expected.
  obj.nested.count++
  obj.arr.push('baz')
}
```

</div>

It is also possible to explicitly create [shallow reactive objects](/api/reactivity-advanced.html#shallowreactive) where the reactivity is only tracked at the root-level, however they are typically only needed in advanced use cases.

<div class="composition-api">

### Reactive Proxy vs. Original \*\*

It is important to note that the returned value from `reactive()` is a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) of the original object, which is not equal to the original object:

```js
const raw = {}
const proxy = reactive(raw)

// proxy is NOT equal to the original.
console.log(proxy === raw) // false
```

Only the proxy is reactive - mutating the original object will not trigger updates. Therefore, the best practice when working with Vue's reactivity system is to **exclusively use the proxied versions of your state**.

To ensure consistent access to the proxy, calling `reactive()` on the same object always returns the same proxy, and calling `reactive()` on an existing proxy also returns that same proxy:

```js
// calling reactive() on the same object returns the same proxy
console.log(reactive(raw) === proxy) // true

// calling reactive() on a proxy returns itself
console.log(reactive(proxy) === proxy) // true
```

This rule applies to nested objects as well. Due to deep reactivity, nested objects inside a reactive object are also proxies:

```js
const proxy = reactive({})

const raw = {}
proxy.nested = raw

console.log(proxy.nested === raw) // false
```

### Limitations of `reactive()` \*\*

The `reactive()` API has two limitations:

1. It only works for object types (objects, arrays, and [collection types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects#keyed_collections) such as `Map` and `Set`). It cannot hold [primitive types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) such as `string`, `number` or `boolean`.

2. Since Vue's reactivity tracking works over property access, we must always keep the same reference to the reactive object. This means we can't easily "replace" a reactive object:

   ```js
   let state = reactive({ count: 0 })

   // this won't work!
   state = reactive({ count: 1 })
   ```

   It also means that when we assign or destructure a reactive object's property into local variables, or when we pass that property into a function, or destructure properties from a reactive object, we will lose the reactivity connection:

   ```js
   const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

   // n is a local variable that is disconnected
   // from state.count.
   let n = state.count
   // does not affect original state
   n++

   // count is also disconnected from state.count.
   let { count } = state
   // does not affect original state
   count++

   // the function receives a plain number and
   // won't be able to track changes to state.count
   callSomeFunction(state.count)
   ```

## Reactive Variables with `ref()` \*\*

To address the limitations of `reactive()`, Vue also provides a [`ref()`](/api/reactivity-core.html#ref) function which allows us to create reactive **"refs"** that can hold any value type:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
```

`ref()` takes the argument and returns it wrapped within a ref object with a `.value` property:

```js
const count = ref(0)

console.log(count) // { value: 0 }
console.log(count.value) // 0

count.value++
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

See also: [Typing Refs](/guide/typescript/composition-api.html#typing-ref) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

Similar to properties on a reactive object, the `.value` property of a ref is reactive. In addition, when holding object types, ref automatically converts its `.value` with `reactive()`.

A ref containing an object value can reactively replace the entire object:

```js
const objectRef = ref({ count: 0 })

// this works reactively
objectRef.value = { count: 1 }
```

Refs can also be passed into functions or destructured from plain objects without losing reactivity:

```js
const obj = {
  foo: ref(1),
  bar: ref(2)
}

// the function receives a ref
// it needs to access the value via .value but it
// will retain the reactivity connection
callSomeFunction(obj.foo)

// still reactive
const { foo, bar } = obj
```

In other words, `ref()` allows us to create a "reference" to any value and pass it around without losing reactivity. This capability is quite important as it is frequently used when extracting logic into [Composable Functions](/guide/reusability/composables.html).

### Ref Unwrapping in Templates \*\*

When refs are accessed as top-level properties in the template, they are automatically "unwrapped" so there is no need to use `.value`. Here's the previous counter example, using `ref()` instead:

```vue{13}
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

function increment() {
  count.value++
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">
    {{ count }} <!-- no .value needed -->
  </button>
</template>
```

[Try it in the Playground](https://sfc.vuejs.org/#eyJBcHAudnVlIjoiPHNjcmlwdCBzZXR1cD5cbmltcG9ydCB7IHJlZiB9IGZyb20gJ3Z1ZSdcblxuY29uc3QgY291bnQgPSByZWYoMClcblxuZnVuY3Rpb24gaW5jcmVtZW50KCkge1xuICBjb3VudC52YWx1ZSsrXG59XG48L3NjcmlwdD5cblxuPHRlbXBsYXRlPlxuICA8YnV0dG9uIEBjbGljaz1cImluY3JlbWVudFwiPnt7IGNvdW50IH19PC9idXR0b24+XG48L3RlbXBsYXRlPiIsImltcG9ydC1tYXAuanNvbiI6IntcbiAgXCJpbXBvcnRzXCI6IHtcbiAgICBcInZ1ZVwiOiBcImh0dHBzOi8vc2ZjLnZ1ZWpzLm9yZy92dWUucnVudGltZS5lc20tYnJvd3Nlci5qc1wiXG4gIH1cbn0ifQ==)

Note the unwrapping only applies to top-level properties - nested access to refs will not be unwrapped:

```js
const object = { foo: ref(1) }
```

```vue-html
{{ object.foo }} <!-- does NOT get unwrapped -->
```

We can fix that by making `foo` a top-level property:

```js
const { foo } = object
```

```vue-html
{{ foo }} <!-- properly unwrapped -->
```

Now `foo` will be unwrapped as expected.

### Ref Unwrapping in Reactive Objects \*\*

When a `ref` is accessed or mutated as a property of a reactive object, it is also automatically unwrapped so it behaves like a normal property:

```js
const count = ref(0)
const state = reactive({
  count
})

console.log(state.count) // 0

state.count = 1
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

If a new ref is assigned to a property linked to an existing ref, it will replace the old ref:

```js
const otherCount = ref(2)

state.count = otherCount
console.log(state.count) // 2
// original ref is now disconnected from state.count
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

Ref unwrapping only happens when nested inside a deep reactive object. It does not apply when it is accessed as a property of a [shallow reactive object](/api/reactivity-advanced.html#shallowreactive).

#### Ref Unwrapping in Arrays and Collections

Unlike reactive objects, there is no unwrapping performed when the ref is accessed as an element of a reactive array or a native collection type like `Map`:

```js
const books = reactive([ref('Vue 3 Guide')])
// need .value here
console.log(books[0].value)

const map = reactive(new Map([['count', ref(0)]]))
// need .value here
console.log(map.get('count').value)
```

</div>

<div class="options-api">

### Stateful Methods \*

In some cases, we may need to dynamically create a method function, for example creating a debounced event handler:

```js
import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'

export default {
  methods: {
    // Debouncing with Lodash
    click: debounce(function () {
      // ... respond to click ...
    }, 500)
  }
}
```

However, this approach is problematic for components that are reused because a debounced function is **stateful**: it maintains some internal state on the elapsed time. If multiple component instances share the same debounced function, they will interfere with one another.

To keep each component instance's debounced function independent of the others, we can create the debounced version in the `created` lifecycle hook:

```js
export default {
  created() {
    // each instance now has its own copy of debounced handler
    this.debouncedClick = _.debounce(this.click, 500)
  },
  unmounted() {
    // also a good idea to cancel the timer
    // when the component is removed
    this.debouncedClick.cancel()
  },
  methods: {
    click() {
      // ... respond to click ...
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

## Reactivity Transform <sup class="vt-badge experimental" /> \*\*

Having to use `.value` with refs is a drawback imposed by the language constraints of JavaScript. However, with compile-time transforms we can improve the ergonomics by automatically appending `.value` in appropriate locations. Vue provides a compile-time transform that allows us to write the earlier "counter" example like this:

```vue
<script setup>
let count = $ref(0)

function increment() {
  // no need for .value
  count++
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

You can learn more about [Reactivity Transform](/guide/extras/reactivity-transform.html) in its dedicated section. Do note that it is currently still experimental and may change before being finalized.
